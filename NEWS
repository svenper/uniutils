Version 2.27 fixes a bug in the -V option of uniname, updates the character
information to Unicode version 5.1, and fixes some other minor bugs.

Version 2.26 renames unirev to unireverse and adds unifuzz, which generates
test input for programs expecting Unicode. Unifuzz can generate a random string
of characters, tokens of various potentially problematic characters and sequences,
very long lines, strings with embedded nulls, and ill-formed UTF-8. 

Version 2.25 adds to unidesc the option -r which causes it to list the ranges
detected after reading all input rather than listing them as they are encountered,
and adds to uniname the option -B which causes it to ignore characters
within the Basic Multilingual Plane.

Version 2.24 adds the utility unirev, which reverses its input. 

Version 2.22 adds the command line option -A, which causes ASCII whitespace to be skipped.

Version 2.20 fixes bugs in unidesc and unihist and adds to uniname the
option of skipping ASCII characters.

Version 2.19 has been updated to Unicode 5.0.

Version 2.18 fixes a bug in which a read interrupted in the midst of
a UTF-8 sequence was incorrectly treated as a truncated sequence.
