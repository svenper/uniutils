#This script provides a handy way to look up Unicode characters from
#the command line.
# Usage: utf8lookup <unicode codepoint as hex text without leading 0x>
# For example, the command:
# 	utf8lookup 0543
# will produce the output:
#       UTF-32   name
#	000543   ARMENIAN CAPITAL LETTER CHEH
#
[ $(( $(printf '\1' | od -dAn) )) -eq 1 ] && end=le || end=be
echo 0x$1 |		 # feed command-line argument to ascii2binary's stdin
ascii2binary -t ui |	 # convert text to unsigned integer
iconv -f ucs-4$end -t utf-8 | # convert utf-32 to utf-8 encoding
uniname -b -c -e -g      # feed to uniname, suppressing byte and character offsets,
			 # UTF-8 encoding, and glyph
