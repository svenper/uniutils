Need to update unirange.c to version 5.1. (character data has been updated.)

Add a script to generate unirange.c.
We can base this on the Consortium file Blocks.txt, but need to integrate
the CSUR blocks and Gaspar Sinai's Hungarian runes block.

Make BMPONLY define for unihist available via configure.

Make empty "ranges" report as such, not as the range before it.

Make zero-width and full-width characters align in columns.
