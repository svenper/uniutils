.TH unihist 1 "May, 2008"
.SH NAME
unihist \- Generate a histogram of the characters in a Unicode file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B unihist ([option flags])
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I unihist
generates a histogram of the characters in its input, which must be encoded
in UTF-8 Unicode. By default, for each character it prints the frequency of the
character as a percentage of the total, the absolute number of tokens in the input,
the UTF-32 code in  hexadecimal, and, if the character is displayable, the glyph itself
as UTF-8 Unicode. Command line flags allow unwanted information to be suppressed.
In particular, note that by suppressing the percentages and counts it is possible
to generate a list of the unique characters in the input.
.PP
Output is produced ordered by character code. To sort it in descending order of frequency,
pipe the output into the command:
.br
.sp
.RS
sort -k1 -n -r
.RE
.PP
By default,
.I unihist
handles all of Unicode. To reduce memory usage and increase speed, it may be compiled
so as to handle only the Basic Multilingual Plane (plane 0) by defining BMPONLY.
